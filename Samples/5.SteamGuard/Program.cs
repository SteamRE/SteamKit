// Sample 5: SteamGuard
//
// this sample goes into detail for how to handle steamguard protected accounts and how to login to them
//
// SteamGuard works by enforcing a two factor authentication scheme
// upon first logon to an account with SG enabled, the steam server will email an authcode to the validated address of the account
// this authcode token can be used as the second factor during logon, but the token has a limited time span in which it is valid
//
// after a client logs on using the authcode, the steam server will generate a blob of random data that the client stores called a "sentry file"
// this sentry file is then used in all subsequent logons as the second factor
// ownership of this file provides proof that the machine being used to logon is owned by the client in question
//
// the usual login flow is thus:
// 1. connect to the server
// 2. logon to account with only username and password
// at this point, if the account is steamguard protected, the LoggedOnCallback will have a result of AccountLogonDenied
// the server will disconnect the client and email the authcode
//
// the login flow must then be restarted:
// 1. connect to server
// 2. logon to account using username, password, and authcode
// at this point, login wil succeed and a UpdateMachineAuthCallback callback will be posted with the sentry file data from the steam server
// the client will save the file, and reply to the server informing that it has accepted the sentry file
// 
// all subsequent logons will use this flow:
// 1. connect to server
// 2. logon to account using username, password, and sha-1 hash of the sentry file
