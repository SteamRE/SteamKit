------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added `SteamApps.PICSGetAccessTokens` overload with singular parameters. (pr #190)
* Added `SteamFriends.RequestMessageHistory` and `SteamFriends.RequestOfflineMessages` (pr #193)
* Added the ability to connect to Developer instances of Steam (`EUniverse.Dev`). If anyone at Valve is using this internally, hi!
* Added the ability to set a `LoginID` in `SteamUser.LogOnDetails` so that multiple instances can connect from the same host concurrenctly. (pr #217)
* Added `SteamClient.DebugNetworkListener` API to intercept and log raw messages. (pr #204)
* Added the ability to dump messages in NetHook2 format for debugging purposes. (pr #204)
* Upgraded the encryption protocol used to communicate with the Steam servers.

* After calling `SteamUser.LogOff` or `SteamGameServer.LogOff`, `SteamClient.DisconnectedCallback.UserInitiated` will be `true`. (pr #205)
* Fixed a crash when parsing a Steam ID of the format '[i:1:234]'.
* Fixed a crash when logging on in an environment where the hard disk has no serial ID, such as Hyper-V.
* Fixed a bug when parsing a KeyValue file that contains a `/` followed by a newline. (pr #187)

* Updated game-related GC messages and protobufs.

BREAKING CHANGES

* Removed obsoleted `ICallbackMsg` extension methods `IsType<>` and `Handle<>`. (pr #221)
* Game Coordinator base messages are now generated per-game, instead of relying on Dota 2. GC messages should use the base messages for their game, which is separated by namespace. (pr #180)

* Added setter for `KeyValue`'s indexer operator.
